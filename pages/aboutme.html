    I am a junior in the advanced computer science class. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym to lift weights, playing League of Legends and volleyball. I played for the boyâ€™s team last year for our highschool and highly enjoyed it. My favorite dish to eat is sushi because it tastes very delicious. <br><br>
